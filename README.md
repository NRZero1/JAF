# JAPF

JAPF is a web application PHP framework with MVC architecture and minimal configuration.

# Background

This framework initially created by me to make cleaner codebases for my projects since I hate how ugly php code can be when the project has become so huge and the code almost unreadable. Thus i created JAPF (Just Another PHP Framework).

Another reason for me to create this is to reduce redundant task that i need to code when i'm working on a project that is not small but can't be called huge either and I'm hesitating using an "adult" framework like [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) for my project becuase it seems like overengineering to me since I'm not using all of that tech/feature.

## Configuring Namespaces

By default, this framework use PSR-4 as namespacing autoload. You can configure the autoload using composer or you can just use it manually.
