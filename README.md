# JAF

JAF is a minimal web application PHP framework with built-in template engine with MVC architecture. This framework created using PHP 8.

>**Warning**
>Since I initally created this to helped me doing my projects and it also uses PHP 8, so I haven't added support for older version, so do it at your own discretion if you want to use this.

>**Note**
>I'm planning adding support for older version too later on but it would probably take some time. If you have suggestion or want to contribute to this project, please read the [**Contributing**](#contributing) section

## Background

This framework initially started when I was working with PHP projects and there is no framework in there and the code is so messy. From there I learned how ugly php code can be when the project became huge and there is no enforcement how you want to style your code.

After that, I received a PHP project that have no frameworks on it again but I kinda don't want to use an adult frameworks like [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) since migrating it kinda daunting and the project is not that big. Also another reason I don't want to use it because while I can read it's documentation but I don't know how it works behind it so I was curious. And since I don't wanna become a person who can use but not understand, I decided to study and make my own frameworks.

And that is the story of why I created **JAF** or **Just Another (PHP) Framework**. (If you're able to guess the reference of this framework's name and why I picked this name then you're probably right ðŸ¤£)
