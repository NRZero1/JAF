# JAF

JAF is a minimal web application PHP framework with MVC architecture. This framework created using PHP 8.

>**Warning**
>Since I initally created this to helped me doing my projects and it also uses PHP 8, so I haven't added support for older version, so do it at your own discretion if you want to use this.

>**Note**
>I'm planning adding support for older version too later on but it would probably take some time. If you have suggestion or want to contribute to this project, please read the [**Contributing**](#contributing) section

## Background

This framework initially created by me to make cleaner codebases for my projects since I hate how ugly php code can be when the project has become so huge and the code almost unreadable.

Another reason for me to create this is to reduce redundant task that I need to code when I'm working on a project that is not small but can't be called huge either and I'm hesitating using an "adult" framework like [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) for my project becuase it seems like overengineering to me since I'm not using all of that tech/feature and I'm not that really understand how it works behind the scenes outside of what documentation told me. And I don't want to become an engineer that only understand how to use this, I also want to know how it works behind the scene.

So to improve my skill as a engineer and to solve problems I mentions above (so this also serve as educational purpose), I created **JAF** or **Just Another (PHP) Framework**.
